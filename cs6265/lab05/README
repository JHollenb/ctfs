# Lab05: dep-aslr

From this week, data sections in each binary (e.g., stack and heap)
are not executable anymore; often konwn as W^X, NX or DEP. Then, where
to place your shellcode? In fact, there are still many different ways
to bypass these protections. Please study reference materials first
and have fun with binaries.
