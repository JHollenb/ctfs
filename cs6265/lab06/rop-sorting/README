 Lab06: rop-sorting
===================

   ROP is known to be Turing Complete. In this lab, we are going to
   implement a sorting algorithm by using ROP. However, note that
   it is fine to utilize exisiting libc functions for sorting.
   
   We will give you extra points if you solve this challenge through
   a generic ROP chain (i.e., not using a libc function).
