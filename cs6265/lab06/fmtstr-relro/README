 Lab06: fmtstr-relro
====================

   Overwriting GOT was so convenient. In fact, we can secure
   a target binary by making the GOT region read-only; just
   bind all functions when the binary is about to launch
   and make the region read-only, so called RELRO
   (RELocation Read Only).
   
   What happen when a program terminates?
   
     $ man atexit
   
   Also, you might want to see these source files from glibc:
   exit.c, atexit.c, cxa_atexit.c and sysdep-64.h
   
   The target binary is:
   
       CANARY    : disabled
       FORTIFY   : disabled
       NX        : ENABLED
       PIE       : disabled
       RELRO     : FULL
