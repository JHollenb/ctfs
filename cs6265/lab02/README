# Lab02: warm-up2

This is another warm-up lab that prepares you with the basic techniques
of writing shellcode, which is a small piece of code used as the payload
in the exploitation of vulnerability. You will learn how to write shellcode
on 32-bit 64-bit architecture. Your shellcode will need to be injected
into the vulnerable binary, and read the flag from /proc/flag under different
circumstances.
