 Lab02: shellcode-ascii
=======================

   In this challenge, you will write a shellcode that contains "pure"
   alphanumeric characters, perhaps to evade a rule-based filtering
   system, such as IDS.  Write a shellcode that reads the flag from
   /proc/flag!
   
   ; build
   $ ./make.sh
   
   ; run your shellcode
   $ cat readflag.bin | ./target
   
   ; submit your flag on the submission site
   
   NOTE. you must get your flag from the ./target binary!
