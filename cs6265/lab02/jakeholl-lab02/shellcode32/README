 Lab02: shellcode32
===================

   This challenge helps you prepare shellcodes on x86 (32-bit) architecture,
   which is a basic step toward writing an advanced exploitation. Write a
   shellcode (asm!) that reads a flag from /proc/flag!
   
    ; build
    $ ./make.sh
   
    ; shellcode to launch
    $ objdump -m i386 -D -b binary shellcode.bin
   
    ; fire
    $ (cat shellcode.bin; echo; cat) | ./test_your_shellcode
    ...
    cat /proc/flag
   
    Unfortunately that is not your flag. Please write a payload
    (readflag.S) that directly reads the flag from the /proc/flag.
   
    ; run your shellcode
    $ cat readflag.bin | ./target 
   
    ; submit your flag on the submission site
   
    NOTE. you must get your flag from the ./target binary!
