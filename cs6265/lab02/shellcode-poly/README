 Lab02: shellcode-poly
======================

   In this challenge, you will be creating a shellcode that works on
   both x86 (32-bit) and x86_64 (64-bit) architectures!
   
   $ cat readflag.bin | ./target
   
   target invokes two ./target32 (32-bit) and ./target64 (64-bit)
   binaries so if successful, it dumps two flags for you.
   
   For testing, you can also invoke it individually against ./target32
   and ./target64. But you must get flags from the ./target to get points.
