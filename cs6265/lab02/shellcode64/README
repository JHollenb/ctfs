 Lab02: shellcode64
===================

   In this challenge, you will preare a shellcode for a 64-bit architecture!
   
   ; build
   $ ./make.sh
   
   ; shellcode to launch
   $ objdump -m i386:x86-64 -D -b binary shellcode.bin
   
   ; fire
   $ (cat shellcode.bin; echo;  cat) | ./test_your_shellcode
   ...
   cat /proc/flag
   
   As you might guess, that is not your flag. Please write a payload
   (readflag.S) that reads the flag directly.
   
   ; run your shellcode
   $ cat readflag.bin | ./target
   
   ; submit your flag on the submission site
   
   NOTE. you must get your flag from the ./target binary!
