# Lab03: buf-ovfl

This lab will teach you how to exploit stack-based buffer overflows,
which are a very common flaw in history, starting from the very first
computer warm. Importantly, learning the basic concept of buffer
overflows is the first step toward learning more sophisticated types
of vulnerabilities later.
