1. The challenge description says that the person used steganography to hide their messages. Steghide is one of the most commonly used steganography tools and you can try to use a cracker like stegcracker (https://github.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker) to bruteforce the password. Using the rockyou.txt wordlist and stegcracker, you will find the password was "iloveyou" and it dumps a text file of the Australian National Anthem.

2. Highlighting the text of the national anthem, you will find that some lines have a white space at the end and others do not. This is using another steganography technique called 'whitespace steganography' that hides the binary of a message as a whitespace or lack of at the end of each line. Is talked about on the Steganography wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) and sufficient material is given if people google 'whitespace steganography'. The flag is hidden this way.
