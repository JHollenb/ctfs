# I think this one is really going to take off
## Description
You'll never believe it but I swear I saw one of those big American refueling planes flying around right over the boxing croc on the first of September. If only I knew its registration number... I bet I'd be able to find out all kinds of information, like the day it first flew.

The flag will be the date of the first flight of the plane I saw in this format: DUCTF{DD-MM-YY}
