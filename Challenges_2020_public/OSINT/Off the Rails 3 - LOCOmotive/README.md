# Off the Rails 3 - LOCOmotive
## Description
~~This challenge would be "insane" if we had that level but hard will do :)~~ Maybe OTR3 isn't as insane as it was originally because we changed the description before we posted :/

There are 2 sections/segments to the flag, each of the sections have two points of data that require you to actually solve rather than by guessing. Each section, each different point and space of the flag is separated by an underscore _ . All of these are Australian places.

Section 1:
Someone took the challenge name to heart, where was it coming from and the military time that it happened?

Section 2:
We don't all live downunder(ground), and when we do its at 1134. What is the colour of the previous occupant's car and the name of the cereal?
