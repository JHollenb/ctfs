# Off the Rails 2: Electric Boogaloo: Far from Home
## Description
Okay so I'm starting to think I *may* have got on the wrong train *again* and now it's snowing so hard I have no clue where I am ðŸ˜¬. Thankfully, I managed to snap this pic before the storm started. We seem to have stopped at this station.. can you tell me it's name?

Please tell me the name of the station in lower case flag format, with any spaces replaced by underscores.
