> My favourite place to grab a snack. Where is this and, how many dishes are there?

You are given a file "dont_dish_out_what_you_cant_take.jpg", it should not bring up any particular results in a reverse image search so you will need to rely on context clues from the image and the challenge description.

The challenge name gives the first hint "Outback Stakeout", indicating the location is in the Australian Outback.

The description further asks how many dishes there are at the location, an indication the location has dishes of some kind.

The image is difficult to analyse as it is pretty low quality, however you can note two parallel mountain ranges on each side of some sort of structure, along with a curving road or dried river of some kind in the bottom left.

Searching up "parallel mountain ranges australian outback" returns several mountain ranges, one of which is the MacDonnell Ranges.

Next, searching up "MacDonnell Ranges dish" will return results including "https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/rare-glimpse-at-the-secrets-of-pine-gap-spy-base-20160226-gn51oa.html"
Alternatively, searching up the MacDonnell Ranges on google maps in satellite view, you can then identify the relevant section of the ranges, running parallel, with a notable structure/facility in between. This location does not have any markers, however a reverse image search of a screenshot of this location will quickly identify it as Pine Gap satellite surveillance base.

A search of something like "pine gap how many dishes" will return a result of 38.
