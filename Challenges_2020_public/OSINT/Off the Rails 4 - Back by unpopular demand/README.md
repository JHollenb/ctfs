# Off the Rails 4 - Back by unpopular demand
## Description
This challenge would be "insane" if we had that level but hard will do :)

There are 3 sections/segments to the flag, each of the sections have two points of data that require you to actually solve rather than by guessing. Each section, each different point and punctuation of the flag is separated by an underscore _. All of these Australian places.

Section 1:
How many cars were at this spot in 2018 and what is the siteID of the 1.77ghz?

Section 2:
How many times did the driver wave and what's the registration number?

Section 3:
We lost the war so we erected a metaphorical fence. Someone built an airstrip over it, what is the name of it and what is the postcode?

Flag format: DUCTF{amountofcars_siteID_amountofwaves_registrationnumber_airstripname_postcode}
