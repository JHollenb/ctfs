# Off the Rails
## Description
I'm in trouble, I'm on the run... My friend told me he would meet me underneath a rail bridge 2km from his house before we escape on a train but he forgot to tell me where he lived.

He took two day trips relatively close by and sent me two photos. I also know that late last year, there was a fire near the suburbs approximately 25km from where he lives.

He lives somewhere in the middle of those three points. Could you tell me the name of the road parallel to the bridge, and the latitude and longitude of the bridge?

P.S. The longitude and latitude should be to 3 decimal places (plus if necessary include the . and/or -). Each segement of the flag should be seperated by an underscore. The road name type should be the same as when you find it. The flag is also case insensitive.

Example: DUCTF{latitude_longitude_nameofroad_roadnametype}
