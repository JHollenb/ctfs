# Koala Habitat
We are provided with Gumtrees.wav, an catchy tune that sounds like it has Morse Code overlaid on it

I personally use Audacity when doing any form of Morse Code related challenge as it allows me to clearly visual any spaces between words.

We end up with the following Morse Code:

-.-. .- .-. .- -- . .-.. .-.. ---     -.- --- .- .-.. .- ...     .- .-. .     - .... .     -... . ... -     -.- --- .- .-.. .- ...

Upon converting that to English we end up with the FLAG:
CARAMELLO KOALAS ARE THE BEST KOALAS
