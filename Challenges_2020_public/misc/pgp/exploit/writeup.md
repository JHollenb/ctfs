This challenge takes advantage of the fact that "random looking" data is not guaranteed to be encryption.

In fact, the message is stored in plaintext, but it is just contained within a gpg *signed* file. Although it appears random, it is plaintext binary data, including the original message, and a signature by an irrelevant private key.

Simply point gpg at the signed file and you get the file contents.

```
user /tmp $ gpg flag.txt.gpg
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
