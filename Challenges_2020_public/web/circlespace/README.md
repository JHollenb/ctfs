# circlespace

**Category:** web

**Difficulty:** medium

**Author:** dot

**Flag:** `DUCTF{n0T_squar3spaCe_7o0N2kf1}`

**Mod note:** flag is case sensitive, dunno if we should mention in the flavourtext

Oh, how I miss /r/place and /r/circleoftrust. That's why I decided to create my own one for y'all to play
with.
