# Leggos
## Author: Crem

Leggos is a beginner web challenge that is a slight variation on the traditional view source challenges. The slight variation being that this challenges includes two very annoying "defense mechanisms" which are disabling right click and disabling ctrl + u. 

These "defense mechanisms" can be bypassed by prepending "view-source:" to the start of the URL. Once you view the source, there is nothing obivious on the `index.html` page. However, if you click on `disableMouseRightClick.js`, the flag will appear at the bottom of the file.
